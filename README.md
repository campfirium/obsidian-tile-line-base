See how TileLineBase turns Markdown into structured records, switches views, and keeps GTD statuses in sync—all in one flow.

## A Powerful & Intelligent Table

Create structured data tables directly within your Markdown notes, flexibly supporting various scenarios.

### Flexible Views: Table, Kanban & Slides

One set of records, three powerful ways to interact:

- **Filtered Table:** Freely combine **Filter** and **Sort** rules into saved views. Slice your data by project, status, or any custom condition.
- **Kanban Board:** Map **any Select or List field** to lanes—not just Status. Easily regroup your data by Priority, Tags, or Author to see a different dimension of your notes.
- **Slide View:** Turn rows into focused slides—perfect for distraction-free thinking or simple presentations. Easily **customize layouts**, with built-in support for **inline images** and **live previews**.

### Smart Fields

Basic **inline formulas** (simple arithmetic), **intelligent date/time parsing**, and **automatic linking** of notes and references—all seamlessly integrated and continuously refined.

### Built-in GTD Workflow

Comes with **built-in task status fields** (Todo, In Progress, Done, On Hold, Someday, Canceled), providing corresponding filtered view groups and Kanban views by default, enabling **immediate and easy task management**.

## A Database Native to Text

Fully text-based, free from complex data formats and extra markup, intuitively supporting structured content.

### Single Note as Database

Aggregate all related structured records tightly within a **single `.md` note**. This maintains **contextual associations**, reduces management overhead, and effectively facilitates overall review and thinking.

### Implicit Structuring

No Frontmatter, no code markup. The data structure is **implicitly contained** within plain text, providing a **human- and machine-friendly** data representation that lets you read and write naturally.

## Open Data Interaction

Supports convenient data interaction and movement across various internal and external platforms, enabling more flexible organization and utilization of information.

### Text Import Wizard

Quickly transform text blocks into valid TileLineBase records. Define simple patterns to map content to fields, **instantly generating the required structure** without manual formatting.

### Seamless Obsidian Integration

Records can move flexibly across different table notes or be converted into **standalone Obsidian notes**; table notes can also be **migrated across Vaults** with all configurations intact.

### Easy Spreadsheet Sync

Supports **CSV import/export**, compatible with mainstream spreadsheet software, allowing **batch editing** and data organization.

### Efficient LLM Communication

Uses a **clear, self-contained plain-text format** that can interact seamlessly with **Large Language Models (LLM)** without additional processing.
